For integer we have 32 bits.

a >> b = a/2^b

Let say int is 8 bits. then 5 would be written as. 5 >> 2

0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 - Remove 2 bit from last in simple.

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 - answer is 1.

Q - How to find the the 3rd bit of a number - 5.

Create a mask - (1<<i) -> 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 
ans then do and - bit = 5 & (1<<i)
